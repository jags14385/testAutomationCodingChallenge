Issue : The Audit Logs are not getting displayed on the Audit screen.
Steps to reproduce :
 - Place an order for 3 kilos of concrete and 
 expect an entry showing the same.
 - Checked at DB : the record exists. Hence an UI issue.
 - Need to determine priority / urgency.
 - Happens across browsers Chrome , Firefox , IE
